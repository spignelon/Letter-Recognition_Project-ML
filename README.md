## Project Description

The Letter Recognition Project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify letters based on their visual features. The project utilizes various classification algorithms, including SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees, to achieve high accuracy in letter classification. It includes data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Letter Recognition Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 20,000 samples, with each sample representing a letter of the alphabet. The dataset contains 16 numerical features that capture different attributes of each letter. You can download the dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/59/letter+recognition) or [alternative link](https://github.com/spignelon/Letter-Recognition_Project-ML/blob/main/letter%2Brecognition.zip).

## Code

The code is implemented in Python and is available in the [Letter_Recognition.ipynb](https://github.com/spignelon/Letter-Recognition_Project-ML/blob/main/Letter_Recognition.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The code is well-documented and organized into sections for easy understanding and reproducibility.

Additionally, you can find the exported Python code from the Jupyter Notebook in the [letter_recognition.py](https://github.com/spignelon/Letter-Recognition_Project-ML/blob/main/letter_recognition.py) file.

## Report

The research report for the Letter Recognition Project is available in the [LetterRecognition_Research_Report.pdf](https://github.com/spignelon/Letter-Recognition_Project-ML/blob/main/LetterRecognition_Research_Report.pdf) file. The report provides a detailed analysis of the project, including the problem statement, methodology, experimental results, and conclusions. It also discusses future directions for potential enhancements and improvements.
